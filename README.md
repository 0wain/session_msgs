# Session Messages
A simple connect/disconnect chat message for gmod


## What is this?
This addon is a simple system that adds chat notifications to every user whenever a player joins/leaves.
This way, you can have a clean yet effective notification system for joining and leaving.

## What are the messages?
With a little Lua knowledge, you can easily change the strings to better suit your server. but by defaults they are as follows:

###### Connect
```
[My Cool Server] Steve has connected to the server.
```

###### Disconnect
```
[My Cool Server] Steve has disconnected to the server. Their SteamID was: STEAM_0:0:49148608
```
